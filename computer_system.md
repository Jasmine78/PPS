##COMPUTER SYSTEM

**Definition:** Is a collection of entities(hardware,software and liveware) that are designed to receive, process, manage and present information in a meaningful format.

##COMPONENTS OF COMPUTER SYSTEM
- **Computer hardware** :- Are physical parts/ intangible parts of a computer. Example input devices, output devices, central processing unit and storage devices
- **Computer software** :- Also known as programs or applications. They are classified into two classes namely - system software and application software
- **Liveware** :- Is the computer user. Also known as orgwareor the humanware. The user commands the computer system to execute on instructions.

a) **COMPUTER HARDWARE**
- Hardware refers to the physical, tangible computer equipment and devices, which provide support for major functions such as input, processing (internal storage, computation and control), output, secondary storage (for data and programs), and communication.

## THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT ( C P U)

Is the brain or the heart of a computer. Is also known as processor and consist of three units namely -
1. Control Unit ( C U)
1. Arithmetic logic Unit ( A L U)
1. Main Memory unit ( M M U)

The system unit is the core of a computer system. Usually it's a rectangular box placed on or underneath your desk. Inside this box are many electronic components that process data. The most important of these components is the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor, which acts as the "brain" of your computer. Another component is random access memory (RAM), which temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on. The information stored in RAM is erased when the computer is turned off.

## FUNCTIONS OF CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
- Process data
- Control sequence of operaions within the computers
- It gives command to all parts of a computer
- It control the use of the main memory in storing of data and instructions
- It provides temporary storage (RAM) and permanent storage (ROM) of data

## THE CONTROL UNIT
Is the center of operations for the computer system, it directs the activities of the computer system.
Functions of Control Unit

# Introduction of Operating System 
An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

An operating system is a software that manages the computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system.

**Functions of Operating system** – Operating system performs three functions:
1. **Convenience:** An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
1. **Efficiency:** An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
1. **Ability to Evolve:** An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.

# Introduction to Compiler
- A compiler is a translator that converts the high-level language into the machine language.
- High-level language is written by a developer and machine language can be understood by the processor.
- Compiler is used to show errors to the programmer.
- The main purpose of compiler is to change the code written in one language without changing the meaning of the program.
- When you execute a program which is written in HLL programming language then it executes into two parts.
- In the first part, the source program compiled and translated into the object program (low level language).
- In the second part, object program translated into the target program through the assembler.
